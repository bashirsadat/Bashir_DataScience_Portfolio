  #      [Project 1: Kmeans_and_Spectral_Clustering](https://github.com/bashirsadat/Kmeans_and_Spectral_Clustering)
  In this project we trying to implement k-means and spectral clustering algorithms to find clusters of genes which exhibit similar expression profiles. Then we will compare the
  two methods and discuss their pros and cons.
  We validate the clustering results using the following methods:
* Choose an external index and compare the clustering results from different clustering algorithms with an external index (the ground truth clusters are provided in the data sets).

# [Project2: Persian Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/bashirsadat/PersianSentmentAnalysis)
  This project presents how to use latent semantic analysis to find the relations between terms and documents of Persian text. I used both Scala and Python for doing this task.
  The base of the work in this paper is chapter six of the Advanced Analytics with Spark book. I used the latent semantic analysis to find relations between documents and terms.
  LSA is an unsupervised learning technique that extracts the essential meaning or most important aspects of a corpus. I used a Dataset of Persian text from Hamshahri Newspaper.
  However, the NLP parts of the chapter did not work on the Persian text. Therefore, I used python to preprocess the texts before running the LSA model on it. I explore the
  complications that the Persian text processing pipeline might have and propose solutions for each of the problems faced.
