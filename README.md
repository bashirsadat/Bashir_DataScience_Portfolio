# [Project 1: Kmeans_and_Spectral_Clustering](https://github.com/bashirsadat/Kmeans_and_Spectral_Clustering)
  In this project we trying to implement k-means and spectral clustering algorithms to find clusters of genes which exhibit similar expression profiles. Then we will compare the
  two methods and discuss their pros and cons.
  We validate the clustering results using the following methods:
* Choose an external index and compare the clustering results from different clustering algorithms with an external index (the ground truth clusters are provided in the data sets).
* Choose an internal index and compare the clustering results.

# [Project3: Classification](https://github.com/bashirsadat/Classification)
  This work involves developing several ML methods to classify the most popular benchmark computer vision datasets. We will work with MNIST and CIFAR-10. We will build traditional
  ML models and deep neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.
